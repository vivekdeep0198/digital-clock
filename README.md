# digital-clock
This project is a Digital Clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time dynamically and updates every second. The clock is styled to look modern, simple, and responsive, making it a great beginner-friendly JavaScript project to learn DOM manipulation, date/time handling, and styling with CSS.
